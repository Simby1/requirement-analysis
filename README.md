# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository serves as a detailed guide to Requirement Analysis, a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It provides a clear and structured overview of the process, its importance, key activities, and various types of requirements. The content is designed to help anyone involved in software projects understand how to effectively define and manage project requirements.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the foundational phase in the SDLC where the project team systematically gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements for a software product. The goal is to ensure that all stakeholders‚Äîfrom developers to end-users‚Äîhave a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should function. It bridges the gap between customer needs and the technical specifications required to build the software.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is crucial for a project's success for several reasons:

- Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what stakeholders expect, reducing ambiguity and potential misunderstandings. A well-defined set of requirements acts as a single source of truth for all project participants.

- Scope Definition: This process clearly defines the project's boundaries, helping to prevent scope creep, which is the uncontrolled expansion of a project's scope after it has begun.

- Basis for Design and Development: Requirements provide a solid foundation upon which the architectural design, development, and testing efforts are built. Without clear requirements, the development team may build the wrong product.

- Cost and Time Estimation: Accurate requirements facilitate more precise estimation of project cost, resources, and timelines, leading to better project planning and management.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The process of Requirement Analysis involves several key activities, often performed iteratively:

- Requirement Gathering: This is the initial step of collecting raw data about the system from various stakeholders. Techniques include interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation.

- Requirement Elicitation: This activity refines and elaborates on the gathered information. Techniques like brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping help in extracting detailed and specific requirements.

- Requirement Documentation: All requirements are formally recorded in a structured format. This includes creating a Requirement Specification Document, User Stories, and Use Cases.

- Requirement Analysis and Modeling: This involves a deeper look at the requirements to prioritize them and check for consistency and feasibility. Modeling with diagrams like Data Flow Diagrams helps to visualize and understand the system.

- Requirement Validation: This final step ensures that the documented requirements are accurate, complete, and meet stakeholder expectations. Review and approval sessions with stakeholders are a key part of this process.

## Types of Requirements
Requirements are generally categorized into two main types: Functional and Non-functional.

### Functional Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è
Functional requirements describe what the system should do‚Äîthe specific actions and behaviors of the software. They define the core functionalities that allow users to achieve their goals.

Examples for a booking management system:

- Search Properties: Users should be able to search for properties based on criteria such as location, price range, and number of bedrooms.

- User Registration: A new user must be able to create an account by providing personal details and a valid email address.

- Booking System: Users must be able to select available dates, confirm their booking, and receive a confirmation email.

- Property Listings: The system should display a list of properties with essential details and high-resolution images.

### Non-functional Requirements üõ°Ô∏è
Non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform. They define the quality attributes of the system, such as its performance, security, and usability.

Examples for a booking management system:

- Performance: The property search results page should load within 2 seconds. The system should be able to handle up to 1000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.

- Security: All user login credentials must be stored using strong encryption. The system must be protected against SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

- Usability: The user interface should be intuitive, and the booking process should require a maximum of five clicks from property selection to confirmation.

- Reliability: The system should maintain an uptime of 99.9% and have a reliable backup and recovery mechanism in place.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are a powerful tool in Requirement Analysis, offering a visual representation of a system's functionalities from a user's perspective.

### What they are:
Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases). They provide a high-level overview of system functionality and are excellent for communicating requirements with non-technical stakeholders.

### Benefits:

- They provide a clear and simple overview of system functionalities.

- They help in identifying and organizing the system's requirements.

- They facilitate effective communication among stakeholders and the development team.

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria are a set of conditions that a user story or feature must meet to be considered complete and acceptable by stakeholders. They are crucial for defining clear expectations and providing a basis for testing and validation.

Importance:

- They prevent misunderstandings by providing a specific, measurable definition of "done."

- They serve as a checklist for quality assurance, ensuring that the final product meets the specified requirements.

- They help in maintaining quality and delivering a product that truly meets user expectations.

Example for the Checkout feature:

Scenario: User can successfully complete a booking.

Given the user has selected a property and entered valid payment details.
When the user clicks the "Confirm Booking" button.
Then the system should process the payment securely.
And the user should receive a booking confirmation on the screen.
And a booking confirmation email should be sent to the user's registered email address within 2 minutes.
And the booked dates should be marked as unavailable in the property's calendar.
